The code performs variable selection for generalized partially linear models for paper: 
A new approach to select linear and nonparametric predictors simultaneously for generalized partially linear models

Run variable_selection_shell.R. 
Set exampleIdx to 1, 2, or 3 in variable_selection_shell.R. to specify the simulation data for Poisson regression models (with varying Poisson regression structures) or Logistic regression models. Refer to the examples provided in the examples.R function for details.
